## Focus

First double-digit endurance run + competitive riding.

## Work Done

- Outdoor run
- Informal bike race

## Output

- Run distance: 10 km (nonstop)
- Time: 1 hour 13 minutes
- Pace: ~7:18 min/km
- Bike race: Won (Avenger bike; advantage from braking control and lower-gear acceleration)

## Time Spent

- Running: 1 hour 13 minutes
- Riding: not tracked

## Notes

First nonstop 10 km completed. Pace dropped as expected with distance jump. Competitive riding again adds risk without contributing to endurance adaptation.
