## Focus

Endurance run + competitive riding.

## Work Done

- Outdoor run
- Two informal bike races with strangers

## Output

- Run distance: 6.5 km
- Time: 42 minutes
- Pace: ~6:28 min/km
- Bike race 1: Won (same CC, busy road, advantage from quick shifting and lower-gear acceleration)
- Bike race 2: Lost (higher CC opponent, empty road)

## Time Spent

- Running: 42 minutes
- Riding: not tracked

## Notes

Hydration target missed. Excessive scrolling. Failed to wake early. Competitive riding added risk without training value.
