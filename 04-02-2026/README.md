## Focus

Longer endurance run + project reactivation.

## Work Done

- Outdoor run
- Resumed temple project after long pause

## Output

- Run distance: 8 km (nonstop)
- Time: 52 minutes
- Pace: ~6:30 min/km
- Temple project: work restarted after ~5 months of inactivity
- Water intake: target missed
- Wake-up time: failed (late-night run at ~8 p.m.)

## Time Spent

- Running: 52 minutes
- Project work: not tracked

## Notes

Night running disrupted morning routine. Hydration discipline still weak. Restarting stalled projects has higher friction than continuing active ones.
